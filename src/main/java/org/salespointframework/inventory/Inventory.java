/**
 * Base interface for {@link InventoryItem} implementations. Choose either {@link UniqueInventory} or
 * {@link MultiInventory} for your application depending on whether you need to keep track of multiple locations (e.g.
 * warehouses) in which {@link InventoryItem}s are supposed to be managed.
 * <p>
 * {@link UniqueInventoryItem} expects a one-to-one relationship to a product, which is equivalent to modeling a single
 * warehouse. That's simple and allows to look up the {@link UniqueInventoryItem} by {@link ProductIdentifier}. I.e. the
 * {@link Quantity} contained in that {@link UniqueInventoryItem} is equivalent to the overall quantity in the system.
 * This is the simpler model in general and should be preferred. {@link Product}s held in {@link UniqueInventoryItem}s
 * are suspect to automatic inventory updates on order completion. See
 * {@link org.salespointframework.inventory.InventoryListeners.InventoryOrderEventListener} for details.
 * <p>
 * If you absolutely need to model {@link Product}s managed in multiple warehouses, use {@link MultiInventoryItem}
 * alongside {@link MultiInventory}. {@link MultiInventory#findByProductIdentifier(ProductIdentifier)} rather returns an
 * {@link InventoryItems} instance. The overall {@link Quantity} of {@link Product}s in the system can then be obtained
 * via {@link InventoryItems#getTotalQuantity()}. {@link MultiInventoryItem}s are not suspect to auto-inventory updates
 * upon order completion as it's not clear which of the {@link InventoryItem}s is supposed to be deducted.
